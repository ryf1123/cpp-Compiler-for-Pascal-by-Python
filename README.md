## MIPS Simulator

> To validate the  output of our Compiler, we use a MIPS simulator  to run the `asm` code generated and watch the process

MAC Install Packageï¼š`./simulator/QtSpim.mpkg`

`initialize and load`ï¼Œload in `.asm`file

Noteï¼šthere should be a `main:` in the loaded `.asm` file, because in this simulator, a jump to`main` is made at first. 

Below is an example `simulator/simulator_example.asm`
